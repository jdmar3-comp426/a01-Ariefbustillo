        The Lord of the Rings was a set of three novels written by J.R.R. Tolkein.
        It was later adapted into a three part film trilogy directed by Peter Jackson. It starred Viggo Mortenson,
        Elijah Wood, and Ian McKellan, among others.
        The Hobbit was a single novel written by Tolkein, and serves as a prequel to the Lord of the Rings. It was then
        made into three movies (more movies than necessary). They weren't great.
